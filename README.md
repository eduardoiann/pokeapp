# PokeApp

## Description

This app was a 4 day project designed to be an technical challenge for a Junior Front-end position at Ilia Digital. It's a Pokemon TCG App that would need to fulfill the following requirements:

  - Must use React,Vue or Angular;
  - Must use the API Pokemon TCG(https://pokemontcg.io/);
  - Be responsive, mobile first;
  - Must utilize routes;
  - The card's list should be ordered by name ASC;
  - Must be able to search cards by name;
  - Location suport (although the translation unnecessary);
  - Functional build (must be able to download and run the code);
  - Unitary Tests
  - E2E Tests;
  - Must utilize SASS;
  - Must utilize React Store and State (Vuex, Redux, etc).
  
  Not all requirements were met, but the MVP is done and fully functional.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all necessary dependencies and packages to run the application.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Inside the code

After running the scripts in the previous section and accessing the main .src folder, you will encounter (no 'pun'kemon intended rsrs) a simple folder structure that reflects the React structure: Components, Pages, Context, Service, Styles and Utils. I'll briefly explain each next:

  ### Components
  
   All components are placed inside this folder. Each one has its specific subfolder, that holds both .jsx and .scss files that makes the said component. For example:
   
   ```
ðŸ“¦src
 â”£ ðŸ“‚components
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚DetailsCard
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œPokeDetailsCard.jsx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œitemDetailsCard.jsx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œpokeDetailsCard.scss
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚Header
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œHeader.jsx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œheader.scss
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚Loading
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œLoading.jsx
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œloading.scss
 ...
```
 Using this method of organization allows me to better visualize each component and to plan ahead how many more components I'll need, or better, how many more components can I still breakdown in smaller segments to better reuse them in the future.
 
 ### Pages
 
  Well, it contains the pages that my application will need. It mostly call the necessary components to render the page itself. The 'MainPage.jsx' for example, aside from the use of Contexts and/or State Effects, only renders three components: Header, Loading and PokeCard.
```
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="Gotta Search 'Em All!" />
      <div className="pokemon-display">
        {pokeData === null || pokeData.length === 0 ? (
          <Loading />
        ) : (
          pokeData.map((pokemon) => {
            return <PokeCard key={pokemon.id} props={pokemon} />;
          })
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
  
```

 ### Context
  
  It holds my Context and Provider. I've used ContextApi to manage the State.
  
 ### Services
 
  Where all the API calls are made. Not much to explain here. Everytime that I needed to fetch data from the API Pokemon TCG(https://pokemontcg.io/), I would use one of the functions inside the index.js file. It provides de data needed to populate the app.
